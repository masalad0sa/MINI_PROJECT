Perfect 👍
Here’s a **realistic 7-day study + build plan** starting from **26 January**, designed exactly for **your AI-based online proctoring system**.
No overload, no paid tools, and **by the end you’ll have something demo-worthy**.

---

# 🗓️ 7-DAY PLAN (26 JAN → 1 FEB)

**Goal:** From prototype → trained AI-assisted proctoring system

---

## 🟢 **DAY 1 – 26 JAN (FOUNDATION DAY)**

### 🎯 Goal: Understand the building blocks

### What to learn

* What is **object detection**
* What is **face mesh & landmarks**
* How webcam pipelines work

### YouTube (watch only these)

1. **YOLOv8 Object Detection Basics**

   * Search: `YOLOv8 object detection python webcam`
2. **MediaPipe Face Mesh Python**

   * Search: `mediapipe face mesh python tutorial`

⏱️ Time: ~2–3 hours

### What to DO

✔ Run **any** YOLO webcam demo
✔ Run **any** MediaPipe face mesh demo
✔ Don’t modify anything yet

📌 **Outcome:**

> “I understand how YOLO & MediaPipe work separately”

---

## 🟢 **DAY 2 – 27 JAN (YOLO HANDS-ON)**

### 🎯 Goal: Object detection for cheating objects

### What to learn

* YOLO classes
* Confidence threshold
* Bounding boxes

### YouTube

* **Train YOLOv8 on Custom Dataset (Ultralytics)**

### What to DO

✔ Run YOLO webcam
✔ Detect:

* person
* cell phone
* book

✔ Print detection count on screen

📌 **Outcome:**

> Phone & multiple people detection works live

---

## 🟢 **DAY 3 – 28 JAN (FACE + GAZE UNDERSTANDING)**

### 🎯 Goal: Attention detection (not rules yet)

### What to learn

* Head pose (yaw, pitch)
* Eye landmarks
* Iris position (basic gaze)

### YouTube

* `mediapipe face landmarks head pose estimation`
* `eye gaze estimation mediapipe python`

### What to DO

✔ Extract:

* yaw
* pitch
* eye center position

✔ Print values (no decisions)

📌 **Outcome:**

> You can **measure attention**, not just guess

---

## 🟢 **DAY 4 – 29 JAN (DATASET CREATION DAY)**

### 🎯 Goal: Create your OWN dataset (most important)

### What to record (short clips)

| Scenario        | Frames |
| --------------- | ------ |
| Focused         | 300    |
| Looking away    | 300    |
| Phone usage     | 300    |
| Multiple people | 200    |

### What to DO

✔ Auto-save frames when:

* phone detected
* face count > 1
* yaw > threshold

✔ Store folders:

```
dataset/
 ├ focused/
 ├ phone/
 ├ multiple_people/
 ├ distracted/
```

📌 **Outcome:**

> You now have **real training data**

---

## 🟢 **DAY 5 – 30 JAN (TRAIN AI MODEL)**

### 🎯 Goal: Replace rules with AI

### What to learn

* Feature vectors
* Classification

### What to DO

1. Create CSV:

```text
yaw,pitch,gaze_x,phone,faces,label
```

2. Train:

* Random Forest (easy)
* OR Logistic Regression

```python
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

3. Test accuracy

📌 **Outcome:**

> AI decides cheating vs focused

---

## 🟢 **DAY 6 – 31 JAN (INTEGRATION + SCREENSHOT LOGIC)**

### 🎯 Goal: Make it a “system”

### What to DO

✔ Integrate:

* YOLO
* MediaPipe
* Trained classifier

✔ If cheating detected:

* Auto screenshot
* Save with timestamp

```text
cheating_logs/
  2026-01-31_10-45_phone.png
```

✔ Display:

* Status
* Confidence %

📌 **Outcome:**

> Fully working **AI proctoring demo**

---

## 🟢 **DAY 7 – 1 FEB (EVALUATION + VIVA PREP)**

### 🎯 Goal: Make it exam-ready

### What to prepare

✔ Accuracy / precision / recall
✔ Confusion matrix
✔ Limitations slide:

* Lighting
* Occlusion
* Webcam quality

### Key viva sentence (MEMORIZE THIS 🔥)

> “We combined rule-based vision with a trained machine learning classifier to improve robustness and reduce false positives.”

📌 **Outcome:**

> Project is **defendable & professional**

---

# 📌 WHAT YOU WILL HAVE AFTER 1 WEEK

✅ Custom dataset
✅ YOLO object detection
✅ Eye + gaze features
✅ Trained ML model
✅ Screenshot evidence system
✅ Strong viva explanation

# 🚀 NEXT (OPTIONAL BUT POWERFUL)

If you want, I can:

* Convert this into **B.Tech final report**
* Write **pseudo-code + flowchart**
* Prepare **10 viva Q&A**
* Help you publish a **mini research paper**

Just tell me what you want next, bro 💪
